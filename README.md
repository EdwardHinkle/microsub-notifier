# Microsub Notifier

This is a microsub notifier "client".

It lets you set up notifications for new content on any of your microsub clients.

It can currently only send webhooks, but I may include other easier to set up notification methods in the future.
For now if you would like to get a notification to your device you can use [ifttt](https://ifttt.com) or a similar service.
